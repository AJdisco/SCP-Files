Edward Song was born in ██████, North Carolina. He took some odd jobs but had very little work life skills until an encounter with SCP-1155 left him in critical condition. However he survived and began to comment about his experience online. Through some mix of sheer luck and determination. he managed to avoid capture by one of the foundation's teams sent to squash out the information leak.  This earned him a well made envelope. requesting his presence. 

Within the next 48 hours. He found himself working among the Internal Affairs division stationed at site 23. Within weeks he rose to director, one of the fastest chain of command climbs seen foundation wide. 

During his third directorate year he went to one of the few all Internal affairs meetings that the foundation has from time to time, He got on rather well with Director ██████ ███████

A few weeks after this meeting he was requested by the Ethics Committee and Director ██████ ███████ to take over site 65 briefly. The real reason being  ██████ ███████ needing to hide from Alpha-1. Song acknowledges this request and fufills the position, Taking well to winding up Alpha-1 and annoying mildly Director Kayla.

Eventually Song transfers back to site 23 and returns to regular duties. Hearing about a month later the passing of his friend and noticing a few files going missing. Requests a transfer to mobile task force ███████ to which he stays assigned to, to this day.
